    <description>Replaces random breakdowns with a maintenance requirement.

&lt;size=28&gt;Features&lt;/size&gt;

Buildings using components will now gradually deteriorate. The odds of a breakdown happening (and requiring replacement components), is directly linked to the amount of deterioration.

To keep your machinery in top shape, your colonists with the construction work enabled will periodically maintain components. As long as components are properly maintained, they cannot randomly break down.

&lt;size=28&gt;Notes&lt;/size&gt;

I'm very interested in any feedback on how these changes affect the difficulty of the game. I've tried to balance it so that it's not too hard/easy - but I'm just one person with one playstyle.
